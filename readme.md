# PAC Tester
PAC Tester is Python flask web server for testing Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) and Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) scripts.  It outputs the resulting proxy based on the specified: URL, Web Server IP, or Source IP. You can see it running at https://pactester.brdbnt.com/

### Features:
* Proxy pac and WPAD script tester, parser and validator 
* Editor coloring and error highlighting 
* Leverages the proxy auto-config JavaScript in Firefox. https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/tip/netwerk/base/ascii_pac_utils.js 

### Options
The web interface has the following options:
| Option | Details |
| :----: | --- |
| URL | The full URL including protocol (e.g. https or ftp), domain, and path (port is optional). E.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config or https://example.com:8443/ |
| Source IP Address | MyIpAddress() will return this IP address. Change this if you want to simulate an internal userâ€™s IP address. |
| Override dnsResolve | (Optional) if specified, dnsResolve(host) will return this IP address. This enables you to simulate an internal webserver. |
